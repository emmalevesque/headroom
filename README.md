# headroom

Audio loudness analyzer and gain adjustment tool for mastering and DJ workflows.

## What is this?

**headroom** simulates the behavior of Rekordbox's Auto Gain feature, but with a key difference: it identifies files with available headroom (True Peak below the target ceiling) and applies gain adjustment **without using a limiter**.

This tool is designed for DJs and producers who want to maximize loudness while preserving dynamics, ensuring tracks hit the optimal True Peak ceiling without clipping.

## Key Features

- **Single binary**: mp3rgain is built-in as a library — only ffmpeg required as external dependency
- **Smart True Peak ceiling**: Based on AES TD1008, uses -0.5 dBTP for high-quality files, -1.0 dBTP for low-bitrate
- **Multiple processing methods**: ffmpeg for lossless formats, built-in mp3rgain for lossless MP3/AAC gain, ffmpeg re-encode for precise gain
- **Non-destructive workflow**: Original files are backed up before processing
- **Metadata preservation**: Audio tags (ID3v2, Vorbis comment, BWF) are preserved during processing, and files are overwritten in place so Rekordbox cue points and other external metadata remain linked
- **No limiter**: Pure gain adjustment only — dynamics are preserved
- **Interactive CLI**: Guided step-by-step process with two-stage confirmation

## Processing Methods

headroom selects the optimal method for each file based on format and headroom:

| Format | Method | Precision | Quality Loss |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| FLAC, AIFF, WAV | ffmpeg | Arbitrary | None |
| MP3, AAC/M4A | mp3rgain (built-in) | 1.5dB steps | **None** (global_gain modification) |
| MP3, AAC/M4A | ffmpeg re-encode | Arbitrary | Inaudible at ≥256kbps |

### Three-Tier Approach for Lossy Formats (MP3/AAC)

Each MP3 and AAC/M4A file is categorized into one of three tiers:

1. **Native Lossless** — ≥1.5 dB headroom to bitrate-aware ceiling
   - Truly lossless global_gain header modification in 1.5dB steps
   - Uses built-in [mp3rgain](https://github.com/M-Igashi/mp3rgain) library
   - Applied automatically (no user confirmation needed)

2. **Re-encode** — headroom exists but <1.5 dB to ceiling
   - Uses ffmpeg for arbitrary precision gain
   - MP3: `libmp3lame` with `-q:a 0` / AAC: `libfdk_aac` (falls back to built-in `aac`)
   - Preserves original bitrate; requires explicit user confirmation

3. **Skip** — no headroom available

## True Peak Ceiling

Based on [AES TD1008](https://www.aes.org/technical/documentDownloads.cfm?docID=731) recommendations. The ceiling depends on bitrate, not format:

| Bitrate | Ceiling | Native lossless requires |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| Lossless (FLAC, AIFF, WAV) | **-0.5 dBTP** | — |
| Lossy ≥256kbps | **-0.5 dBTP** | TP ≤ -2.0 dBTP |
| Lossy <256kbps | **-1.0 dBTP** | TP ≤ -2.5 dBTP |

## How It Works

1. Scans the current directory for audio files (FLAC, AIFF, WAV, MP3, AAC/M4A)
2. Measures LUFS (Integrated Loudness) and True Peak using ffmpeg
3. Categorizes files by processing method:
   - **Green**: Lossless files (ffmpeg)
   - **Yellow**: MP3/AAC files with enough headroom for native lossless gain
   - **Magenta**: MP3/AAC files requiring re-encode
4. Displays categorized report
5. Two-stage confirmation:
   - First: "Apply lossless gain adjustment?" (lossless + native MP3/AAC)
   - Second: "Also process files with re-encoding?" (MP3/AAC requiring re-encode)
6. Creates backups and processes files

## Important Notes

- **Files are overwritten in place** after backup — Rekordbox metadata remains linked
- Only files with **positive effective gain** are shown and processed
- MP3/AAC native lossless requires at least **1.5dB headroom** to be processed
- MP3/AAC re-encoding is **opt-in** and requires explicit confirmation
- macOS resource fork files (`._*`) are automatically ignored

## Technical Details

### Why 1.5dB Steps?

Both MP3 and AAC store a "global_gain" value as an integer. Each ±1 increment changes the gain by `2^(1/4)` = **±1.5 dB**. This is a format-level constraint, not a tool limitation.

headroom uses the built-in [mp3rgain](https://github.com/M-Igashi/mp3rgain) library to directly modify this field — no decoding or re-encoding involved.

### Bitrate-Aware Ceiling for Native Lossless

Since native lossless gain only works in 1.5dB steps, at least 1.5dB of headroom to the target ceiling is required:
- **≥256kbps**: Target -0.5 dBTP → requires TP ≤ -2.0 dBTP
- **<256kbps**: Target -1.0 dBTP → requires TP ≤ -2.5 dBTP

Example: 320kbps file at -3.5 dBTP gets 2 steps (+3.0dB) → -0.5 dBTP (optimal)

### Re-encode Quality

At ≥256kbps, re-encoding introduces quantization noise below -90dB — far below audible threshold. Only gain is applied (no EQ, compression, or dynamics processing), and original bitrate is preserved.
